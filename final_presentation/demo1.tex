\frame{\frametitle{Demonstration: Improved Scalability via ALM}
Experiment Setup:
\begin{itemize}
\item Test image taken yesterday
\item Training images taken over 1 year ago
\item 38 training images per subject
\item 20 subjects with lowest alignment residual of the 109 subjects in gallery
\item Single threaded implementation in OpenCV
\item Dual-Socket Quad-Core Intel Xeon 2.66GHz
\end{itemize}
Timings for {\bf IPM } based pipeline:
\begin{itemize}
\item Alignment stage $\approx$ 65\ s
\item Resampling stage $\approx$ 3\ s
\item Recognition stage $\approx$ {\color{red} 90}\ s
\end{itemize}
Timings for {\bf ALM } based pipeline:
\begin{itemize}
\item Alignment stage $\approx$ 65\ s
\item Resampling stage $\approx$ 3\ s
\item Recognition stage $\approx$ {\color{red} 8}\ s!
\end{itemize}
