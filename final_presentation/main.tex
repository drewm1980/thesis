%\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
%%%\subsection{Recap}
%\frame{ \frametitle{Recap} By prelim had proposed a complete face recognition pipeline for face recognition,
%but it wasn't fast enough yet for commercial application}
%\frame{ \frametitle{Recap} Since prelim, have dramatically improved the speed of the system without sacrificing
%performance.}
%%%\subsection{Future Work}
%\frame{ \frametitle{Improve acquisition system using multiplexed illuminations } }
%\frame{ \frametitle{Merge iterative alignment, SRC, and LBP} }
%\frame{ \frametitle{Increase arithmetic intensity} Mention work in progress on subgradient descent methods.
%take advantage of tallness of the arrays, geometry of the $\ell_1$ minimization problem}
