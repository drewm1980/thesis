\frametitle{Improving the acquisition system hardware}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Users have a hard time holding still $\Rightarrow$ limit on the number and quality of training images we can take
	\item Best way to improve training images: increase training image acquisition speed!
	\item Better Cameras $\Rightarrow$ Higher image transfer rate
	\item Better Cameras $\Rightarrow$ Better Synchronization features allowing interleaved transfer
	\item Projector Improvement: Automatic exposure control
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Save time on illuminations where there is plenty of intensity
		\item Avoid saturation
		\item Avoid low SNR
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Improving the acquisition system hardware (Contd.)}
\begin{itemize}	
	\item Projector Improvement: Better Synchronization
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Take apart projector, gain access to frame sync signal
		\item Use this sync signal to begin/end exposure
		\item Avoids need to be conservative with the timing
	\end{itemize}
	\item Projector Improvement: Boost intensity and uniformity
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Currently have slight aliasing between color wheel and camera exposure
		\item Color wheel wastes illumination intensity
		\item $\Rightarrow$ Rip out or disable the color wheel!
	\end{itemize}
	\item Not all proposed modifications will work out; element of luck when modifying proprietary hardware!
\end{itemize}
