\chapter{$\ell_1$-Minimization Techniques}
\label{chap:minimization}

\section{Introduction}
While the previous chapters were dedicated to presenting a design for a highly robust
recognition pipeline, the remaining chapters are dedicated to optimized implementation
of the pipeline presented in Chapter \ref{chap:pipeline}.  To recap, the core of the recognition
pipeline consisted of solving $\ell_1$ minimization problems with the following to forms:

\begin{equation} \min \|\xx\|_1\quad \mbox{ subj. to }\quad \bb = A\xx.
\label{eq:l1min} \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\min_{\xx, \ee} \| \xx \|_1 + \|\ee\|_1 \quad \subj \quad \bb = A \xx + \ee.
\label{eq:l1min_denoise}
\end{equation}
